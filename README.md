# Quadratic Voting Platform

## Product Vision

The application structures around communities in which members can collaborate on initiatives. A community typically has a set of goals and wants to engage its members to work towards those goals. The way to organize the communityâ€™s work is through initiatives, which are proposals to take action on specific topics. The community can propose new initiatives, up/downvote and even fund initiatives so that the most popular initiatives can become the focus of the community and be implemented. Its members can actively work on the implementation of the initiatives which gives them the chance to earn money but more generally gain a reputation within the community.

The initiative based model allows community to focus on action and lets its members be a key piece in the decision making process. Ultimately, a community that successfully implements the right initiatives can become more valuable and share its success with its members.
